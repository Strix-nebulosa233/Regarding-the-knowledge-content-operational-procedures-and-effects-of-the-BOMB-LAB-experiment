Student Helping Student Program: If you're struggling with coursework in computer systems or other assignments that require reverse engineering techniques, you might find this personal report and reflection I submitted helpful
First, observe the code you have, which calls from phase_0 to phase_6(Of course, in some versions, it calls from phase_1 to phase_6, reducing one issue). After each phase succeeds, the program outputs different prompts, and the phase numbers increase sequentially and clearly. This indicates that there are seven issues waiting to be addressed. Finally, based on the hints(/* Wow, they got it!  But isn't something... missing?  Perhaps. * something they overlooked?  Mua ha ha ha ha! */), it can be guessed that this experiment has a hidden question, which can be temporarily referred to as Question 8.
Next, let's go through this experiment step by step.

# phase_0
